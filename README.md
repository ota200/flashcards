# A simple flash cards App 

## What is this? 
This is just a simple flashcard app I made so far i have been doing it for ```2 months```

## How to use? 
So far, I am in the beta stages of this app, still working on the features and styling of this app. Its is also only a web app right know. 

## Why did I make this app 
I just wanted to create a app that could be actualy usefull for me, and release it for free. Also quizlet isn't really free anymore so this is sort of a open sourced but a bit less collabortative version of that. I am also in the future going to try to add features from apps like : 
- RemNote ( active recall, recursion)
- Notion ( easy to use commands, and simple ui )
- Monkeytype ( custimization )

This app is something I will be working on and off for a few months (3-4), and really its just for , so if you want to use this app, it might be a while for these features to be relased. 

# Releases 
So far I have only one release, though its not in beta, things dont save, and has extremely basic ui/ux. Put you can still view the release notes here:
